# SCTP Formalisation in Promela

This repository contains a partial reimplementation of
the article "A Formal Analysis of SCTP: Attack Synthesis and Patch Verification"
for the RSX217 CNAM course.

The code is heavily inspired by the original code, I don't have the skills in Promela and formalisation
to reimplement it just by reading the article.
My approach to write the code was to:
1. Try to implement it without looking at the original code, i.e. using the article and the RFC 9260
2. If the code wasn't working using the first approach I would read the original code and reimplement it myself with some personal modification most of the times
